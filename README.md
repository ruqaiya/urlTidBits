## Things to do

Since I didn't have time at all during the week to work on the project in detail' please find the following list without which I wouldn't like to commit my work.

1) writing unit tests
2) Functionalities:
	1) Cater Urls in all format. Not only the specific method defined.
	2) Cater HTTPS urls as well.
	3) If a social media page is entered like facebook.com, the social media handles functionality breaks. I would have liked to fix that.
3) Make the UI much better.

## Notes

The following URLS are tested: 'taxals.com', 'google.com', 'facebook.com'
Please be very speciifc to the url format you enter.
